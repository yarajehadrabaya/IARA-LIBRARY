# Project Name: IARA Library System

### What is the goal of this website?
This project is focused on creating a library system where students can easily browse, borrow,
and return books, while admins manage the collection of books. Admins will have special
access to add, edit, and remove books, while students can only borrow and return available
books. Anyone visiting the website can search and view the list of books, but only registered
users can borrow them. The system will be designed to work well on all devices and provide a
smooth, user-friendly experience.
